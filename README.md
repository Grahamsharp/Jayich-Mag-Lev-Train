# Magnetic Levitation Train Project
In this guide we will be detailing our approach to creating a mag-lev train, starting with the theory of how maglev trains work, and then moving into our adaptations and how we had to modify our designs many times. The goal of the project was to build a working maglev train, which has several significant advantages over traditional trains. The most important is that friction from wheels interacting with the tracks is reduced to 0, meaning the only limitation on the speed is air resistance. Air resistance can be eliminated by building the train in a vaccuum tube and this is the idea behind Hyperloop, and its effects are often times reduced by designing the front of the train to mimic nature, notably the kingfisher bird. Most of the materials for this project were taken from the dumpster behind the UCSB Physics building.
## Theory

There is a theorem from the mid 1800's named Earnshaws theorem that states that it is impossible to create a stable configuration of ferromagnets without any mechanical aid, and we only discovered this very late into the project time frame. Real maglev trains deal with this by flipping the polarization of powerful electromagnets, which functions both as a propulsion mechanism, and also balances the train. This is akin to having a series of leaf blowers arranged around a hill so that if a ball starts to roll down it it is pushed back up. As you can see from this analogy, it is a tricky thing to pull off, and we did not have the ability to get the magnets needed or the expertise to utilize them, so we took a different tack.

## The Track



## Building and Balancing the Car

After realizing that our initial goal of balancing the train completely with magnetic fields was unnatainable, we decided to opt for the minimal necessary mechanical stabilization to keep our cart floating, as seen above. We designed the car out of wood as there was a lot of tinkering required. Since we had opted for a monorail design the expansion and contraction of all the pieces with temperature would throw off the alignment, so there was constant screwing and unscrewing of the cart. For stabilization we acquired ball rollers and screwed them into our car, which was carefully measured so that the car would snugly hug the track. There were many different models that we tried,from enourmous hunks with multiple cars to the model shown above, which was made from poplar and slimmed down. We eventually got it so that the car would balance on its own without us holding onto it, however there was still instability when moving that was addressed later on in the build. 

## Propulsion attempt 1

Our inital attempt to make the train actually move was to create a bunch of walls hanging down from an over hanging track, with their magnetic field lines arranged as shown below.

I then build power lines that straddled the track, and the plan was to attach an electromagnet to the top of the car and then use infrared sensors to control a transistor to let in power to the electromagnet and suck it in the the next wall system before turning it off and so on. This fell apart when the magnet arrived and either our powersupply was inadaquate or something was wrong with the magnet, because when plugged in it gave nowhere near enough force to move the train forward. We then had to switch to plan b, which was use materials scavenged from our building phase to make a belt rolling system. 



## Propulsion attempt 2
After our disasterous first attempt we were running low on time, and so we had to create a working propulsion system using what we had. We built rollers out of a cardboard tubing that we took from a dumpster as a joke due to its comically large length, and nailed them to a couple pieces of wood and used hot glue to smooth everything out. We then attached a motor to the edge as shown here.

We then ran into an issue where when we added the belt that we were going to use to propel the train, there was nowhere near enough torque in the motor to actually turn the belt, let alone propell the train. We were in a state of dispair
