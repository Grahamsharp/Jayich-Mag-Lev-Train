# Magnetic Levitation Train Project
In this guide we will be detailing our approach to creating a mag-lev train, starting with the theory of how maglev trains work, and then moving into our adaptations and how we had to modify our designs many times. The goal of the project was to build a working maglev train, which has several significant advantages over traditional trains. The most important is that friction from wheels interacting with the tracks is reduced to 0, meaning the only limitation on the speed is air resistance. Air resistance can be eliminated by building the train in a vaccuum tube and this is the idea behind Hyperloop, and its effects are often times reduced by designing the front of the train to mimic nature, notably the kingfisher bird. Most of the materials for this project were taken from the dumpster behind the UCSB Physics building.
## Theory

There is a theorem from the mid 1800's named Earnshaws theorem that states that it is impossible to create a stable configuration of ferromagnets without any mechanical aid, and we only discovered this very late into the project time frame. Real maglev trains deal with this by flipping the polarization of powerful electromagnets, which functions both as a propulsion mechanism, and also balances the train. This is akin to having a series of leaf blowers arranged around a hill so that if a ball starts to roll down it it is pushed back up. As you can see from this analogy, it is a tricky thing to pull off, and we did not have the ability to get the magnets needed or the expertise to utilize them, so we took a different tack.
## Balancing the Car

After realizing that our initial goal of balancing the train completely with magnetic fields was unnatainable, we decided to opt for the minimal
