# Magnetic Levitation Train Project
In this guide we will be detailing our approach to creating a mag-lev train, starting with the theory of how maglev trains work, and then moving into our adaptations and how we had to modify our designs many times. The goal of the project was to build a working maglev train, which has several significant advantages over traditional trains. The most important is that friction from wheels interacting with the tracks is reduced to 0, meaning the only limitation on the speed is air resistance. Air resistance can be eliminated by building the train in a vaccuum tube and this is the idea behind Hyperloop, and its effects are often times reduced by designing the front of the train to mimic nature, notably the kingfisher bird. Most of the materials for this project were taken from the dumpster behind the UCSB Physics building.

There is a theorem from the mid 1800's named Earnshaws theorem that states that it is impossible to create a stable configuration of ferromagnets without any mechanical aid, and we only discovered this very late into the project time frame. Real maglev trains deal with this by flipping magnet
